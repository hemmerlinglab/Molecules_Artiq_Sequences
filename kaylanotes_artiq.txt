- user- written experiments should usually derive from the artiq.language.environment.EnvExperiment sub class pg 48
- multiple pipelines ensure that experiments scheduled in one pipeline will never conflict with those of another pipeline over resources
- CCBs are requests made by experiments to perform some action --> possibly needed in our code?
