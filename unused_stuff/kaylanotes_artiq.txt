- user- written experiments should usually derive from the artiq.language.environment.EnvExperiment sub class pg 48
- multiple pipelines ensure that experiments scheduled in one pipeline will never conflict with those of another pipeline over resources
- CCBs are requests made by experiments to perform some action --> possibly needed in our code?



Questions to Figure out
	1. How to use the different classes and modules described in section 13 of the manual


Plan on getting questions answered:
	1. look at the berkeley experiment repo or artiq repo to see how these different functions and classes are implemented, this will give good examples on how to use them
